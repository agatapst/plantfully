Project is a simple app for people interested in indoor plants (or for whom just do not want to kill them).

Then, it is possible to add favourite plants to local storage and recall flower demands when needed.

### Status
The basic version of the project is done. In the future, there are plans to add Wikipedia API with plant images.

### Additional info
The idea to create Plantfully was to help myself in my own cultivation of indoor plants. The whole concept as well as project layout and structure were designed by me.
